## About

[graph-it.netlify.app](https://graph-it.netlify.app/)

A very nice graph visualizer. I've got a lot of good feedback on this project.

This is my first project in React + Redux, made 2 years ago, but it's still my favorite.

Pretty complex and feels very easy to use. Also it uses raw canvas, no library. And the code is pretty organized, but to be fair the CSS could be better.

## Features

1. Add nodes with click.
2. Add edges by dragging from one node to another.
3. Edit the graph in text form.
4. Regenerate randomly the nodes, edges or entire graph.
5. BFS and DFS algorithms.
6. A tutorial similar to Discord.
7. Has nice animations and is very smooth.
